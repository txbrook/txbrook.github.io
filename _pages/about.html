        I am currently a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the UTHealth School of Public Health.
        Previously, I received my M.S. in Biostatistics from Columbia University and my B.S. in
        Mathematics from The Ohio State University.

        I am currently conducting research at MD Anderson Cancer Center, where my work focuses on
        applied machine learning, causal inference, and artificial intelligence for biomedical and
        public health applications.
